					Like most London creatives I grew up in one of the home counties; Kent. I studied electronics because "there's no jobs in web design". I later landed my first job in web design and unglamorously made ecommerce sites. But I was soon packing my bags and heading eastward to begin a new life in Old Street.

					Tucked away in the back streets our small studio was busily overhauling the Witch? website. It allowed me to experiment with some early responsive-design principles, and I developed a Javascript WYSIWYG editor to output articles that adapted to the screen size.

					I then joined the then marketing agency Independents United where I was responsible for developing a range of digital campaigns for brands such as ASOS, Sky and Diageo. I also developed the internal venture Dare to Donate; a fundraising platform which has since raised thousands for charity. Over time the company changed and so did my role. It gave me the opportunity to learn about producing and I managed social for Diageo World Class. My day-to-day would include content creation and communicating it to the 30 global markets.

					Concurrent to this I founded the hardware blog Techmog.com which covers product design and the maker movement in London. Today we are a team of writers who do an amazing job at showing what London is making.
