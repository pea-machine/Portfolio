				My name is Peter Bailey. When you put my names together you get Petiley. So instead I use peabay.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like most London creatives I grew up in one of the home counties; Kent. In Kent I studied electronics because "there's no jobs in web design". Later, I landed my first job in web design. I made ecommerse sites and it was horrible, but soon I was packing my bags and heading eastward to begin a new life in Old Street.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lots has happened since then. I grew a beard. I went on holiday. And now I've settled in I've realised that there's way too much to learn, do and see and I'm never going to fit it all in. So every inch of my days are spent doing my favourite things.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of those things is running London's most loved, and only, blog about hardware startups. Joined by some passion-filled friends we consume all of the hardware-related happenings in London and spill it out into words on the internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Techmog lets me combine my other favourite things - making, coding, photography, writing, design, marketing, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDvbYpyuP5D" target="_blank">3D printed unicorns that fart bubbles</a>. And I pull everything I learn together into my work as a web developer.
