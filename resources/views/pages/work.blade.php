                <h2>Dare to Donate</h2>
                <p>The aim was to combat donation fatigue by making people want to give to charity. The app asked fundraisers put to their friends a number of chllenges they would be willing to do. A vote for one of these dares costs a single donation to charity. When the voting is finished all funds go to their chosen charity and the fundraiser completes the winning challenge.</p>
                <p>We worked with anti-bullying charity Ditch the Label to build a bespoke version which was graced by TV and YouTube personalities. We were also approached by Macmillan to run a trial with them.</p>
                <p>The app was featured by JustGiving and exhibited at the launch of their API. Since then the app has raised thousands for charity and is loved by hundreds of charities.</p>

                <p>I founded, designed and built the product design blog which covers the maker community in London. Techmog's brand was inspured by the community's growing preference for blazing colours and bold design.</p>
                <p>We focus on hardware in London, covering everything from hobby projects to product design. We use a technical perspective to discover how products are made. With this we aim to change the way people think about the products they use and inspire them to create their own.</p>

                <h2>Adorer</h2>
                <p>Adorer was a highly successful tool to build your Twitter following which, unfortunately, had its plug pulled.</p>
                <p>It's known that liking people's tweets would sometimes return a follow back. Do this enough and you can build a decent following. But do it too much and you risk annoying people. Adorer was designed to like people's tweets very quickly but only once per person.</p>
                <p>Until Twitter decided that it was the wrong side of borderline inappropriate the app was generating revenue with a monthly subscription.</p>
