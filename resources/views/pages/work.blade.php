				<p>I'm a full stack developer by trade and passionate about making as a whole. My journey in code has let me work on some amazing brand accounts like Sky, ASOS, Vue Cinemas and Macmillan.</p>

				<p>I've also had the pleasure to work with Belkin on a crazy contraption to showbase WeMo Maker, DIAGEO - managing their global social media activity for World Class and GAP - planning the launch party of one of their Kensington stores.</p>

			<h2>Dare to Donate</h2>
			<p>The internal project at Independents United started as a small app to help a colleague raise money for charity. After a hugely successful campaign I lead the rebuild to turn it into a platform anyone could use.</p>

			<p>The service allows fundraisers to raise money by charging donors to vote for challenges. We were one of the first apps to use JustGiving's API and it continues to grow in popularity.</p>

			<p>The UX and design is a product of months of analysis and user feedback to make sure donors are getting through the process and paying as quickly as possible.</p>

		<h2>Sky Fortitude</h2>

		<p>We were briefed to create something cool and different on Tumblr for the new TV series Fortitude. Our design was a flow of scattered content which was seemingly random in position. The posts follow a spine which runs down the page and the position of content is slightly randomised.</p>
		<p>The author is able to control the behaviour of posts by adding various tags to the post. For example, 'hero' forces images and videos to become full-width, breaking the spine and then allowing it to continue afterwards.</p>

			<p>Tumblr's template engine was limiting in that it couldn't generate HTML for each of appearances that we needed, so the varying post styles all used the same HTML and modified only with CSS and JavaScript.</p>

			<p>In hindsight Tumblr was the wrong platform to use, but the set of challenges that came with it were a lot of fun to solve. Sky later decided to use the template with the TV show Critical.</p>

		<h2>Techmog</h2>
		<p>The maker movement and all things related have been pretty underreported in London. I founded the blog Techmog.com to cover London's hardware community. We follow the journey of makers from invention to investment, taking a look at how they've created their product, and aim to get others hooked on building physical projects.</p>

		<h2>Adorer</h2>
		<p>Tasks to encourage users to follow accounts on social media can be repetitive, so are perfect for automating. I discovered that a good percentage of people follow you when you favourite their tweet, however the tactic is prone to error and favouriting the same person more than once can lead to their irritation.</p>

		<p>I coded a simple program which allowed me to search and favourite tweets, but not more than once for each person. The program became Adorer and has helped grow hundreds of accounts to thousands of followers. The service has also been extended to Instagram.</p>
